# Algorithms-Data-Structures Coding Challenges 

Reverse a String. Write a function that takes in a string and reverses it.

Palindrome. Write a function that tells if a given string reads the same backward as forward.

Reverse an Integer. Given an integer, write a function that reverses it.

maxChar Given a string, return the character that is most commonly used in the string.

fizzBuzz. Write a function that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n.
But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.

Chunked. Given an array and chunk size, divide the array into many subarrays
where each subarray is of length size.

Anagrams (also solved with the sort method)

Capitalize Write a function that accepts a string.  The function should capitalize the first letter of each word in the string then return the capitalized string.

Pyramid Write a function that accepts a positive number N. The function should console log a pyramid shape with N levels using the # character.  Make sure the pyramid has spaces on both the left *and* right hand sides.

Steps Write a function that accepts a positive number N. The function should console log a step shape with N levels using the # character.  Make sure the step has spaces on the right hand side!
